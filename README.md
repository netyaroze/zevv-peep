Zevv's notes:

This is a font I designed for working comfortably on my new high
resolution (1920x1200, 15.4") notebook display. It is heavily based on
Jim Knobles 'neep-alt' font.

The font is available in both iso8859-1 (Latin-1 Western Europe) and
iso8859-15 (Latin-9 Western europe + euro sign) encoding.

The available sizes are 8x16 and 10x20 pixels. I also provide a
alternative 7x14 font, mainly the same characters as the 8x16, but more
densly packed and a few modifications to make wide characters fit in
the bounding box. I don't recommend this, though.
